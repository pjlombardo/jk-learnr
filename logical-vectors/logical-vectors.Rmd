## The basics of logical vectors
I like to think of logical vectors (sometimes called *boolean* vectors) as the answer key to a TRUE/FALSE quiz. The vector `logic1` below is an example; notice it just contains a collection of five values, which can be either `TRUE` or `FALSE`: 
```{r echo =T}
logic1
```
In our case, we can think of `logic1` as the answer key to the following quiz:

```{r fig.align='center'}
kbl(df_numbers) %>% kable_styling()
```

Wait, can't we get a computer to do that?  Of course!

In the code below, we first create a vector of numbers (`quiz_numbers`) that we wish to test against the value of **10**.  Next, we compare `quiz_numbers` to the value of 10 using a `<` symbol. 

Try it out! Is `R` an A-student?
```{r quiz-compare-10, exercise = TRUE}
quiz_numbers<-c(1, 12, 4, 3, 15)

# now let's compare
quiz_numbers < 10
```

#### Exercise:
Consider the following True/False quiz.
```{r}
kbl(df_numbers2) %>% kable_styling()
```
As we did above, use `R` to get create the answer key in a logical vector. (*Hint:* you will need to create your own `quiz_numbers2` vector of values to compare against 15. We got you started.)
```{r quiz-compare-15, exercise = TRUE,exercise.lines=3}
quiz_numbers2 <- c( ... )
# After setting your numbers, write your comparison below
```

```{r quiz-compare-15-hint-1}
quiz_numbers2<- c(15, 19, 14, 3, 10, 18)
# Now write the comparison
```

```{r quiz-compare-15-hint-2}
quiz_numbers2<- c(15, 19, 14, 3, 10, 18)
# Now write the comparison
quiz_numbers2 > ...
```

```{r quiz-compare-15-solution}
quiz_numbers2<- c(15, 19, 14, 3, 10, 18)
# Now write the comparison
quiz_numbers2 > 15
```



## Other ways to compare numbers!
There are many ways to compare numbers in `R`, but these are the most common:
```{r}
kbl(
    data.frame(Symbol = c("<","<=",">",">=","==","!="),
               Meaning = c("strictly less than", "less than or equal", "strictly greater than", "greater than or equal", "equal to", "not equal to"))
) %>% kable_styling()
```

For fun, we wrote some comparisons below. Make sure the outputs make sense to you!

(You can run the lines below one at a time by highlighting a given line, and then hitting "Run Code.")
```{r comparisons, exercise=TRUE}
10 == 12
12 == 12

c(1, 2, 3, 4) <= 3
c(1, 2, 3, 4) < 3

10 !=12
12 !=12
```

### An application of numerical comparisons
Suppose we have a data frame with observations on 150 students; specifically we track their heights and IQs and record it in `students`.  We want to know what percentage of our sample is taller than 72 inches, the unit used in my data frame. How can logical vectors help with this task?

In `R`, logical values are also stored as numbers. Specifically, `TRUE` is treated as 1, and `FALSE` is treated as 0. To get our percentage, let's start by figuring out which students are taller than 72 inches.  Since there are 150 students, we will not want to do this by hand.  Instead, let's use a numerical comparison to generate a logical vector. Use the Code chunk below to 

1. get the `height` variable from the `students` data frame, and
2. compare that variable against 72 with the appropriate comparison symbol.

```{r student-height, exercise = TRUE}
# Place your code here
```

```{r student-height-hint-1}
students$height ...
```

```{r student-height-hint-2}
students$height > ...
```

```{r student-height-solution}
students$height > 72
```

How many of these are `TRUE`? Since each `TRUE` corresponds to a 1, and all the `FALSE` values correspond to zero, if we use the `sum()` command on this logical vector, it will naturally count all the `TRUE` responses!

```{r student-height-sum, exercise = TRUE}
sum( ...place logical here...)
```


```{r student-height-sum-solution}
sum(students$height > 72)
```

To convert this to a percentage, we simply divide by our sample size of 150. Write your final code to get the percentage of students above 72 inches in height.
```{r student-height-perc, exercise = TRUE}
# Place your code here.
```

```{r student-height-perc-solution}
sum(students$height > 72)/150
```

#### Quick practice:
What percentage of the students in the `students` data frame have an IQ less than or equal to 115?
```{r student-IQ1, exercise = TRUE}
# Place your code here.
```

```{r student-IQ1-solution}
sum(students$IQ <= 115)/150
```

What percentage of the students in the `students` data frame have an IQ exactly equal to 100? (Remember you need a "double equals" to compare equality!)
```{r student-IQ2, exercise = TRUE}
# Place your code here.
```

```{r student-IQ2-solution}
sum(students$IQ == 115)/150
```

## Text comparisons
We are also able to compare ***text*** in `R`.^[Text may also be referred to as "strings" or "characters". In `R`, these are often stored as **factors**, which are basically just character vectors with some added metadata.] However, text comparisons involve (mostly) different operators. In this section, we will discuss just a few of them: `==` and `!=`, the `%in%` operator, and the `grepl()` function.

We will do some initial explorations using a small version of the `iris` data set, which records flower measurements for three different species of iris. We call it `small_iris`. To make our output manageable, we have taken a subset of the original `iris` data frame that only includes three of each kind of flower, and we list the species and sepal length variables. When we are more comfortable, we will explore a larger data set. For now,

```{r echo = TRUE}
small_iris
```
Notice that the first three rows are `setosa`, the next three are `versicolor`, and the last three are `virginica`.


### Will the real `setosa` please stand up?
Suppose I want to find out how many of the flowers in `small_iris` are setosa irises. Sure, I could just view `small_iris` and count, but this doesn't scale very well. What if my data frame had 10,000 flowers?

As we saw in the last section, and easy way to count something is to `sum()` up a logical vector, where the entries we care about are labeled as `TRUE`. Since the `Species` variable is text, we can create such a logical vector by checking for *equality* with the desired "setosa" label.

#### Exercise
Run the code below to see the logical vector. Then, 

* use the `sum()` function to count the number of setosa irises in `small_iris`. 
* Finally, write your own code to count the number of "virginica" irises.

```{r small-iris-ex1, exercise=TRUE,exercise.lines=4}
small_iris$Species == "setosa"
```
```{r small-iris-ex1-hint-1}
small_iris$Species == "setosa"
sum(small_iris$Species == "setosa")
```
```{r small-iris-ex1-hint-2}
small_iris$Species == "setosa"
sum(small_iris$Species == "setosa")
sum(small_iris$Species == "virginica")
```

#### Exercise
The not equal comparison, `!=`, works on text as well.  Using a similar coding approach as the previous exercise, count how many flowers in `small_iris` are ***not equal*** to `setosa`.
```{r small-iris-ex2, exercise=TRUE,exercise.lines=4}
# Place your code here
```
```{r small-iris-ex2-hint-1}
#Complete the code below by putting something in the quotes!
small_iris$Species != "..."
# then sum this logical vector
```
```{r small-iris-ex2-solution}
sum(small_iris$Species!="setosa")
```
**Important Note:** If you get a count of zero and that is unexpected, ***check your spelling!***

### Checking a list with `%in%`
The `%in%` operator in `R` will check if text is in a provided list.  For example, can you explain what the code below does?
```{r echo = T}
small_iris$Species %in% c("virginica","versicolor")
```


```{r in-operator-question}
question_text(
  "Why are the first three entries `FALSE`? *In your own words*, explain what the code does! <br></br> Submit your explanation below to see an example written by us! <br></br> (***Note***: all responses are marked 'correct,' so please compare your answer against ours.",
  answer_fn(function(value) {
    if (grepl(".*", value)) {
      correct("Thanks for your work writing your explanation! How does it compare with ours?")
    }
  }), message="The vector `small_iris$Species` contains text recording the species of each flower.  The `%in%` operator checks whether a given value from this vector is  ***in***  the list provided: `c(\"virginica\",\"versicolor\")`.  <br></br> Since the list provided contains only `virginica` and `versicolor` as options, the first three entries are False because they correspond to `setosa` flowers.  The last six entries are True because these are either `virginica` or `versicolor`."
)
```

#### Exercises with `tweets`
The `tweets` data frame contains several tweets pulled from a Kaggle data set (@tweet_data)^[To create the `tweets` dataframe, we used the command line to just pull the first thousand tweets from this much larger Kaggle data set.] 

Use the triangle in the upper right corner to see the `text` variable, which contains the tweets.
```{r}
tweets %>% head()
```
(*Yes... we know... twitter is gone.  Think of them as text messages.*)

By investigating the first six rows of this data set, we appear to be observing a semi-heated exchange between a customer and someone at sprint customer service.  Are all the tweets in the data frame from these two users?

**Exercise.** Recall the `nrow()` command will tell us the number of rows in a data frame.  Below that code, write your own code using the `%in%` operator to see how many of the `author_id` values are either "115712" or "sprintcare".
```{r tweets-ex1, exercise=TRUE,exercise.lines=4}
nrow(tweets)
# Place your code here
```
```{r tweets-ex1-hint-1}
nrow(tweets)
# Fill in the list
tweets$author_id %in% c(...)
# then sum this logical vector
```
```{r tweets-ex1-solution}
nrow(tweets)
sum(tweets$author_id %in% c("115712", "sprintcare"))
```

**Exercise.** What percentage of the tweets in this data set are classified as "inbound". (*Careful*: While the values in the `inbound` variable are True or False, this is not currently stored as a logical vector in `R`!)
```{r tweets-ex2, exercise=TRUE,exercise.lines=4}
#Place your code here
```
```{r tweets-ex2-hint-1}
tweets$inbound == "True"
# sum this and divide by the number of rows
```
```{r tweets-ex2-solution}
sum(tweets$inbound == "True")/nrow(tweets)
```

***

**Challenge:** Can you think of a way to re-write your answer to the previous exercise that uses the `!=` operator?

#### You're doing great!
What if we want to see how often a certain word, like "good" or "bad", appears in the text of a tweet?  

Well, for that we'll a function called `grepl()`!



## Using `grepl()`
The `grepl()` function helps us search text data for different patterns, i.e. specific sequences of letters and symbols. The functions returns a logical vector indicating whether a pattern appears in that piece of text.  

Using our TRUE/FALSE quiz analogy, we can think of `grepl()` as a quick what to generate an answer key to the following quiz. 
```{r}
kbl(df_cat) %>% kable_styling()
```
Notice that 

* We have added the **cat** emphasis above to help make the answer key clear.
* Notice that **cat** is our "pattern", and it can appear *anywhere in the text*, even as part of a completely different word.

Using `grepl()` is straightforward in simple cases; it asks for a `pattern` first, and then text to search through (using the argument `x`). For example,
```{r echo = TRUE}
grepl(pattern = "cat", x = "I like cats.")
# We can drop the argument names, but remember the order!
# the pattern must come first, then the text to be searched.
grepl("cat", c("I like cats.","I love dogs."))
```

### `grepl()` with the `small_iris` data set
Suppose we want to create a logical vector that identifies `setosa` flowers only.  Well, what "pattern" differentiates `setosa` from the other species of `virginica` and `versicolor`? There are many answers here, but one is that `setosa` contains the letter sequence **set**.

Run the code below to verify this identifies the first three rows (the setosa irises) as `TRUE`.  Then, come up with two of your own "patterns" to distinguish this species of flower. Try them out!
```{r grepl-ex1, exercise=TRUE,exercise.lines=3}
grepl("set", small_iris$Species)
# Try your own!
```
```{r grepl-ex1-hint-1}
grepl("set", small_iris$Species)
grepl("osa", small_iris$Species)
#one more
```
```{r grepl-ex1-solution}
grepl("set", small_iris$Species)
grepl("osa", small_iris$Species)
grepl("t", small_iris$Species)
```

Consider this question:
```{r grepl-question1}
question_text(
  "Can you explain why `grepl(\"e\", small_iris$Species)` would not identify `setosa` ***only***? <br></br> Submit your conclusion to see an example written by us! <br></br> (***Note***: all responses are marked 'correct,' so please compare your answer against ours.",
  answer_fn(function(value) {
    if (grepl(".*", value)) {
      correct("Thanks for writing your answer! How does yours compare with ours?")
    }
  }), message="The command `grepl(\"e\", small_iris$Species)` would look for an \"e\" *anywhere* in the searched text.  Since v**e**rsicolor contains an \"e\" also, this would identify those flowers as well.  It would come back False on `virginica` however, which does not have an \"e\". "
)

```

### `grepl()` with the `tweets` data set
So, which word will appear more often in the messages stored in `tweets$text`, "good" or "bad"? Well, go explore using `grepl()`. 

**Exercise** Use the code below to count the number of occurrences of **bad** and **good** among the messages in the `text` variable of the `tweets` data frame. Don't forget to *sum()* your logical vectors!
```{r grepl-ex2, exercise=TRUE,exercise.lines=6}
# count good
grepl(...)

#count bad
grepl(...)
```
```{r grepl-ex2-hint-1}
# count good
grepl("...", tweets$text)

#count bad
grepl("...", tweets$text)
```
```{r grepl-ex2-solution}
# count good
sum(grepl("good", tweets$text))

#count bad
sum(grepl("bad", tweets$text))
```


**Exercise.** In the last section, we saw a back-and-forth between a customer and Sprint customer service.  I wonder, does Verizon do customer service over twitter? Let's check to see if any tweets have "Verizon" appearing in the `text`.
```{r grepl-ex3, exercise=TRUE,exercise.lines=2}
# Here is a dplyr pipe to incorporate sum()
grepl(...) %>% sum()

```
```{r grepl-ex3-hint-1}
grepl("...", tweets$text) %>% sum()

```
```{r grepl-ex3-solution}
sum(grepl("Verizon", tweets$text)) %>% sum()

```

**Exercise.** What percentage of the `text` messages in `tweets` contain the hashtag symbol, \#?
```{r grepl-ex4, exercise=TRUE,exercise.lines=2}
# Here is a dplyr pipe to incorporate sum()
grepl(...) %>% sum()/nrow(tweets)

```
```{r grepl-ex4-hint-1}
grepl("...", tweets$text) %>% sum()/nrow(tweets)

```
```{r grepl-ex4-solution}
grepl("#", tweets$text) %>% sum()/nrow(tweets)

```

### Quick aside, using `!` on logical vectors
If you place an exclamation point before a logical vector, it will switch all the True-False values. For example,
```{r echo = T}
grepl("dog", c("dog","hotdog","cool cat"))
!grepl("dog", c("dog","hotdog","cool cat"))
```

With this in mind...

**Exercise.** What percentage of the `text` messages in `tweets` ***do not contain*** the at-symbol, @?

(*Note*: the order of operations with `!` gets tricky, so we do not recommend a `dplyr` pipe for this. The solution does show you what a dplyr pipe would look like though.)
```{r grepl-ex5, exercise=TRUE,exercise.lines=2}
# Here is a dplyr pipe to incorporate sum()
!grepl(...)
```
```{r grepl-ex5-hint-1}
sum(!grepl("...", tweets$text))
```
```{r grepl-ex5-solution}
sum(!grepl("@", tweets$text))/nrow(tweets)
# or
(!grepl("@",tweets$text)) %>% sum()/nrow(tweets)
```


## Some `grepl()` cautions
It is very easy to fool yourself with `grepl()`.  You think you did a pretty straightforward search, and you get some things returning, but the matches may not quite be what you expect. 

#### Exploring on your own!
In the text box, you can put in your own search patterns (*no need for the quotations*). Below it, the first ten messages that match your search criteria will appear.  Spend a minute or two exploring, before following the examples provided afterward.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
textInput("pattern", "Search Pattern", value="fun")
tableOutput("textMatch")
```

```{r, context="server"}
output$textMatch <- renderTable({
    filter(tweets, grepl(input$pattern, tweets$text)) %>%
    select(text) %>% slice(1:10)
})
```

### Example
Hey, let's read some funny **cat** messages. Use the tool above to search **cat**, and read the messages. Did *any* of them mention a cat? Where are all the **cat**s?

> Remember: the pattern can appear *anywhere* in the searched text, even as part of a completely different word!

### Example
We saw 13 messages with **Verizon** in it. But, what if someone forgot to capitalize? Try searching **verizon** with a lowercase "v".

> Keep in mind: the grepl() searches *are case sensitive*.

Our general recommendation is to always look at some of the searched data after using `grepl()` to make sure your pattern is identifying what you hope it does.  To learn how to do that, though, we'll need another lesson.

Lastly, the search patterns that we can use in functions like `grepl()` can be quite sophisticated. There is a special "syntax" or language called *regular expressions* that help us refine exactly what we want to find.  If you are interested, please see our introductory lesson on regular expressions (LINK HERE).
