## Introduction to filtering rows
It is often the case that our data sets will contain *more* observations than we actually need for a given task or analysis.^[Being able to remove rows from view or consideration is also a very important skill for *cleaning* data and for *exploring* data.]  Hence, we will often want to remove rows from a data frame before doing our work. 

> We will refer to the process of removing rows from a data frame as ***filtering rows***.^[We mainly use the "filtering rows" language to remind us of the `filter()` command we will use from the `dplyr` package.]

For example, suppose we have a data set of all the movies released in the past 10 years. *However*, we intend to study only the movies released in the past two years.  Before doing our work, we would need to remove the movies in the data set that were released outside of the appropriate time period for our study.

In `R`, we can choose the rows we want to keep by either 

* listing the *row numbers* we want, or
* identifying desired rows using *logical vectors*.

We will introduce both approaches, but focus on the second.  Moreover, there are two syntaxes that we can use in `R`:

* The syntax used in base `R`, and
* A more readable approach using the `filter()` command from `dplyr` (@dplyr).

For our money, the best approach (because it makes most sense to humans) is to use logical vectors in combination with the `filter()` command. So this will be the main goal of the lesson!

To explore and practice *filtering with rows*, we will use three data sets:

* `movies`: a data frame of the top 200 grossing movies from 2023, also from Kaggle (@TopMovies2023)
* `tweets`: a smaller, cleaned version of a data set of tweets from Kaggle (@tweet_data)


#### Let's get started!


## Base `R` filtering
Filtering rows (and selecting columns) in base `R` uses square braces appended to a data frame. The general syntax looks like `df[row_condition, columns_desired]`.

* the `row_condition` can either be a vector of row numbers that we want, ***or*** a logical vector.  If we provide a logical vector, we will get only those rows that correspond to `TRUE` in the logical vector.
* the `columns_desired` is a list of column names we want in the smaller data frame.

Let's consider an example with the `movies` data set, which records the rank, title, and box office gross revenue for the top 200 movies in 2023. Suppose we want the first five rows of the `movies` data frame, and only the `Title` and `Total.Gross.Million` measurements.  Remember that `1:5` generates a vector counting from 1 to 5, we could do the following:
```{r echo =T}
# Just a reminder
1:5
# below is the code to "slice" our iris data frame as we wanted
movies[1:5, c("Title","Total.Gross.Million")]
```

We can also use a logical vector as our `row_condition`. (For a review on logical vectors, please visit this lesson (LINK HERE!!!!).) 

**Exercise.** Recall that `movies$Total.Gross.Million < 300` will return a logical vector indicating each row where the `Total.Gross.Million` measurement is less than 300 (million). If we put the code for this logical vector in the first space of the square braces (i.e. `movies[ ..here.., columns_desired]`), the data frame we return will only include those rows that grossed less than 300 (million). Please do the following:

* Run the code below to verify that *Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny* grossed less than 300 (million).
* Write your own similar code to check which movies in the sample had gross earnings above 350 (million).

```{r base-r-ex1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
movies[movies$Total.Gross.Million < 300, c("Title","Total.Gross.Million")]
# Write your new code below

```
```{r base-r-ex1-hint-1}
movies[movies$Total.Gross.Million < 300, c("Title","Total.Gross.Million")]
# Write your new code below
movies[movies$Total.Gross.Million >= ..., c("Title","Total.Gross.Million")]
```
```{r base-r-ex1-solution}
movies[movies$Total.Gross.Million < 300, c("Title","Total.Gross.Million")]
# Write your new code below
movies[movies$Total.Gross.Million >= 350, c("Title","Total.Gross.Million")]
```
**Check your work:** Only 6 movies should have grossed more than 350 million.

### Moving forward with `dplyr`
While it is good to know the "base-`R`" approach in case you see it in someone else's code, this approach has a number of shortcomings:

* It takes a lot of writing to do fairly simple filtering of rows and selecting of columns;
* It's not very "human readable," at least when compared to the alternative we are about to show you.
* If you want to filter rows by a collection of conditions, the code gets unmanageable and difficult to read.

In the next section, we will demonstrate how to use functions from the `dplyr` package to `filter()` rows and `select()` columns, with a particular emphasis on working with rows. 

Since the `filter()` function will use logical vectors as inputs, take a moment to review some of the operators that create logical vectors. (We recommend this lesson (LINK HERE !!!).)
```{r comparisons-table}
kbl(
    data.frame(Symbol = c("<","<=",">",">=","==","!=",
                          "\\%in\\%", "grepl(`pattern`, `x`)"),
               Meaning = c("strictly less than", "less than or equal", "strictly greater than", "greater than or equal", "equal to", "not equal to",
                           "check if text appears in a list",
                           "search `x` for a match with `pattern`"),
    Example = c("`movies$Rank` < 10", 
                "`movies$Rank` <= 10",
                "`movies$Rank` > 150", 
                "`movies$Rank` >=190",
                "`movies$Release.weekday` ==\"Fri\"",
                "`movies$Release.weekday` !=\"Fri\"",
                "`movies$Release.weekday` %in% c(\"Fri\",\"Sat\")",
                "grepl(\"Universal\",`movies$Distributor`)")),
    caption = "Table 1: Comparisons and functions for creating logical vectors in R."
) %>% kable_styling()
```

**Quick, informal, review!** Go through each example in the table above. What kind of rows does each logical vector identify in the `movies` data set?

```{r in-operator-question}
question("Ready to see the answers?",
answer("Yes.", correct = TRUE),
post_message = "`movies$Rank < 10`: rows containing the top *nine* ranked movies. (Note the strict inequality!)<br><br>`movies$Rank <= 10`: rows containing the top ten ranked movies.<br><br>`movies$Rank > 150`: rows containing the movies ranked 151 or worse.<br><br>`movies$Rank >= 190`: rows containing the movies ranked 190 or worse. <br><br>`movies$Release.weekday ==\"Fri\"`: movies released on a Friday. <br><br>`movies$Release.weekday !=\"Fri\"`: movies *not* released on a Friday. <br><br>`movies$Release.weekday %in% c(\"Fri\",\"Sat\")`: movies released on a Friday or a Saturday. <br><br>`grepl(\"Universal\",movies$Distributor)`: Movies with a distributor containing \"Universal\" in their name; likely just *Universal Pictures*."
)
```


#### Let's go!


## Using `filter()` from `dplyr` package
The `filter()` function from `dplyr` works by allowing use to provide a list of logical comparisons that we want all remaining rows to satisfy. We find the syntax to be more readable; here is an example:
```
movies %>%
    filter(Total.Gross.Million > 300,
           Distributor != "Universal Pictures")
```
The syntax allows us to read from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, just like we are reading a book.^[Also notice that we do not need to write the data frame name each time we specify a logical vector. Inside `filter()`, we write `Total.Gross.Million > 300` instead of `movies$Total.Gross.Million > 300`.  This saves a lot of typing, as does the auto-fill option in Rstudio!] Looking at our code above, we can see

1. We start with the `movies` data frame
2. We `filter()` some rows according to the following two criteria:
    a. The `Total.Gross.Million` measurement must be greater than 300, ***and***
    b. The `Distributor` of the movie is ***not*** Universal Pictures.
    
Reading the appropriate `dplyr` code is like reading a recipe for how we "cooked" the final data frame.

If we want to choose specific columns, we can follow up our `filter()` with a `select()` command, where we can list our column names ***without quotes***.^[The `dplyr` package also has functions to help us grab collections of column names, read about "selection helpers" [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html). We will save these shortcuts for a different lesson.]

<br>
**Exercise.** Please do the following:

1. Run the code below to see how a `filter()` and `select()` work together.
2. ***Then, modify the code*** to 
    * return rows where 
        * the `Distributor` ***is either*** "Universal Pictures" or "Lionsgate",  and 
        * the movies rank in the *top* ten;
    * we see the title, total gross in millions, and the release weekday variables.

(*Note*: remember you can use `names(movies)` to list the variable names of the data frame.)
    
```{r filter-ex1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 7}
# First run the code provided to get a feel for it.
# Then MODIFY it to the specifications in part 2!
movies %>%
    filter(Total.Gross.Million > 300,
           Distributor != "Universal Pictures") %>%
    select(Title, Rank, Total.Gross.Million)
```

```{r filter-ex1-hint-1}
# Keep modifying the code!
movies %>%
    filter(... <= 10,
           Distributor ... c("Universal Pictures","...")) %>%
    select(Title, Total.Gross.Million, ...)
```

```{r filter-ex1-hint-2}
# Keep modifying the code!
movies %>%
    filter(Rank <= 10,
           Distributor ... c("Universal Pictures","Lionsgate")) %>%
    select(Title, Total.Gross.Million, ...)
```

```{r filter-ex1-solution}
movies %>%
    filter(Rank <= 10,
           Distributor %in% c("Universal Pictures","Lionsgate")) %>%
    select(Title, Total.Gross.Million, Release.weekday)
```
**Check your work:** There should be exactly three movies appearing in this list.


<br></br>
**Exercise** Write your own code to return a data frame with only the `Title` and `Rank` variables, and only containing rows where:

* the letter sequence "me" appears somewhere in the `Title`
* the `Rank` of the movie is in the top 100 (i.e. 1, 2, ... or 100)
* the `Total.Gross.Million` falls between 100 and 300.

We gave you some starter code for this exercise. Here are two suggestions as you begin thinking about your code:

* For each bullet-point above, think about the comparison (`<`, `>`, ...) or function (`grepl()`, ...) that will help you identify the rows that satisfy the criterion. (See Table 1 from the previous section for a more complete list.)
* For the last bullet point, you could consider using the `between()` function from `dplyr`, [(documentation here)](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/between.html), but it is not necessary.

```{r filter-ex2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 8}
movies %>% 
    filter(
        ...
    ) %>% 
    select(...)
```

```{r filter-ex2-hint-1}
movies %>% 
    filter(
        ...
    ) %>% 
    select(Title, Rank)
```

```{r filter-ex2-hint-2}
movies %>% 
    filter(
        grepl(..., Title),
        ...
    ) %>% 
    select(Title, Rank)
```

```{r filter-ex2-hint-3}
movies %>% 
    filter(
        grepl(..., Title),
        Rank <= ...,
        between(Total.Gross.Million, ..., ...)
    ) %>% 
    select(Title, Rank)
```

```{r filter-ex2-solution}
movies %>% 
    filter(
        grepl("me", Title),
        Rank <=100,
        between(Total.Gross.Million, 100, 300)
    ) %>% 
    select(Title, Rank)
```
**Check your work:** Only two movies will satisfy this criteria.

### Amazing work!
Our last section has some practice applications with the `tweets` data frame. These will give you a great opportunity to practice with using logical vectors in conjunction with `filter()` and `select()` to create the data frame of your dreams!


## Applications with `tweets`
Recall that the `tweets` data frame contains a sample of real tweets. Please review the data frame below. (Remember, the black triangle in the upper-right corner shows more columns of the data frame.) 
```{r echo=TRUE}
head(tweets)
```
It is not obvious what the middle two variables measure, so note that 

* `num_chars`: counts the number of "characters" in the `text` entry. In other words, it is the total count of letters, numbers, spaces, and symbols that appear in the tweet.
* `num_words`: counts the number of "words" in the `text` entry.  Here a "word" is interpreted as contiguous letters, numbers, or symbols with no spaces. For example, "\@11213" has one word, but "\@11231 Hi Maizy" has three words.


### Exercises!
Using what you have learned in this lesson, write code that creates the data frames desribed below.  So that you can verify your work, we list the number of rows that should appear in the final data frame.

**Exercise**.  Which `author_id` names have the word "Care" in them? (The capital C is important!) To answer this question:

1. Create a data frame that has only one variable, `author_id`, and only returns rows where the `author_id` contains the letter sequence "Care".
2. When you have your data frame ready, pipe the data frame into the `distinct()` command. (I.e. `data frame code %>% distinct()`)

```{r tweets-ex1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines =5}
tweets %>%
    ...
```

```{r tweets-ex1-hint-1}
tweets %>%
    filter(...) %>%
    select(...) %>%
    distinct()
```

```{r tweets-ex1-hint-2}
tweets %>%
    filter(...) %>%
    select(author_id) %>%
    distinct()
```

```{r tweets-ex1-hint-3}
tweets %>%
    filter(grepl("...",...)) %>%
    select(author_id) %>%
    distinct()
```

```{r tweets-ex1-solution}
tweets %>%
    filter(grepl("Care",author_id)) %>%
    select(author_id) %>%
    distinct()
```
**Check your work:** There should be three unique author IDs with "Care" in them.
<br></br>

**Exercise**. Our friend is looking for a particular kind of tweet message.  She wants:

1. It must come from a source where the `author_id` contains "Help", because she wants an example of a customer service tweet;
2. The `text` should not contain the hashtag symbol, \#; (*Hint:* use `!grepl(...)`)
3. the number of characters (`num_chars`) should be less than 40.

With these kind of rows selected, she wants the `author_id`, `num_chars`, and the text of the tweet.

```{r tweets-ex2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}
tweets %>%
    ...
```

```{r tweets-ex2-hint-1}
tweets %>%
    filter(grepl(...),
       !grepl(...),
       num_chars ...) 

```

```{r tweets-ex2-hint-2}
tweets %>%
    filter(grepl("...",author_id),
       !grepl("...",text),
       num_chars < ...) %>%
    select(author_id, num_chars, text)
```

```{r tweets-ex2-hint-3}
tweets %>%
    filter(grepl("Help",author_id),
       !grepl("...",text),
       num_chars < 40) %>%
    select(author_id, num_chars, text)
```

```{r tweets-ex2-solution}
tweets %>%
    filter(grepl("Help",author_id),
       !grepl("#",text),
       num_chars < 40) %>%
    select(author_id, num_chars, text)
```
**Check your work:** This should return only *one* message from AmazonHelp!

<br></br>


**Exercise**.  Create a data frame where the tweet text contains "\@Verizon" somewhere, there are fewer than 100 characters, and between 5 and 15 words. Return the `text` of the tweet only.

```{r tweets-ex3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}
tweets %>%
    ...
```

```{r tweets-ex3-hint-1}
tweets %>%
    filter(grepl(...),
           between(...),
           num_chars ...) %>%
    select(...)
```

```{r tweets-ex3-hint-2}
tweets %>%
    filter(grepl("...", text),
           between(num_words, ..., ...),
           num_chars < ...) %>%
    select(text)
```

```{r tweets-ex3-hint-3}
tweets %>%
    filter(grepl("...", text),
           between(num_words, 5, 15),
           num_chars < 100) %>%
    select(text)
```

```{r tweets-ex3-solution}
tweets %>%
    filter(grepl("@Verizon", text),
           between(num_words, 5, 15),
           num_chars < 100) %>%
    select(text)
```
**Check your work:** There should be extactly five rows here.
