Git Repository for LearnR lessons designed for a bio-informatics course.

Lessons include:

* A lesson on logical (boolean) vectors: `logical-vectors`.
    * A follow-up lesson applying logical vectors to filtering rows of a data frame: `filtering`.
* A lesson building on logical vectors and grepl() to do an application on 23 and Me data: `23nMe`

For those hosting these lessons on a shiny server, please note that the 
files must be *locally rendered* to create the .HTML-file before they will 
work.
